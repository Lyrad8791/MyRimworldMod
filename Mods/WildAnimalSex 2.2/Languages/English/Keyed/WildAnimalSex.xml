	<WildAnimalSexModSetting>Wild Animal Sex Prey Population Limit Setting</WildAnimalSexModSetting>
	<preyLimitDesc>You can adjust the prey population limit from 1 (extremely low prey population limit) to 9 (very high population limit). Set 10 if you want unlimited animals on your map, although I have no idea why you want to do this to yourself...
