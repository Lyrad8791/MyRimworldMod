	<description>Replace wall type and doors on the fly. No need to deconstruct and then build another. Features smart building where it won't try to replace walls that are already that type. You can replace mineable things with walls and doors; it will set the mineable to be mined and your constructors will prioritise mining anything in the way of blueprints, then construct.

Mod makers can look into the Vaccine class comments to see how to make new walls/doors/conduits replaceable without this mod updating to support them.

Note: this is a quick and dirty update to Jamestec's A16 build to ensure compatibility with B18. If he makes a new version of his mod, I'll take this one down.
